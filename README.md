# Pasture-data

1. We want to investigate the pasture rent structure with respect to the grass variety over
   various districts in Minnesota. The data set “pasture-data.csv” provides 67 rows of data.
2. The data columns include:
    - I, index
    - X1, the rent per arable acre (dollars)
    - X2, the number of milk cows per square mile
    - X3, the difference between pasturage and arable land
    - Y, the rental price per acre for this variety of grass (dollars)
3. We seek a model of the form:
      Y = B0 + B1 * X1 + B2 * X2 + B3 * X3
4. Complete the analysis using 2 of the following tools (R, SAS, or Excel). Perform the following
steps, perform a complete exploratory data analysis (EDA) for each X variable (descriptive
statistics, plots, etc), Regression analysis: draw a scatter plot of Y and X variables & observe if
there are linear relationships, check for multi-collinearity between X variables, fit the multiple
linear regression model, generate parameter estimates, evaluate goodness of fit tests (F-test,
individual parameter test, coefficient of determination), complete a residual analysis(validate:
constant variance, linear relationship, normal distribution, potential outliers), evaluate and
provide the optimal final model and make predictions on rental price per acre.
