# Pasture-data

We want to investigate the pasture rent structure with respect to the grass variety over
various districts in Minnesota. The data set “pasture-data.csv” provides 67 rows of data.
The data columns include:
I, index
X1, the rent per arable acre (dollars)
X2, the number of milk cows per square mile
X3, the difference between pasturage and arable land
Y, the rental price per acre for this variety of grass (dollars)
We seek a model of the form:
Y = B0 + B1 * X1 + B2 * X2 + B3 * X3
Complete the analysis using 2 of the following tools (R, SAS, or Excel). Perform the following
steps, perform a complete exploratory data analysis (EDA) for each X variable (descriptive
statistics, plots, etc), Regression analysis: draw a scatter plot of Y and X variables & observe if
there are linear relationships, check for multi-collinearity between X variables, fit the multiple
linear regression model, generate parameter estimates, evaluate goodness of fit tests (F-test,
individual parameter test, coefficient of determination), complete a residual analysis(validate:
constant variance, linear relationship, normal distribution, potential outliers), evaluate and
provide the optimal final model and make predictions on rental price per acre.
